There was an issue where the propane was congregating into one of the corners.  Changing the direction of updating cells caused it to
change which corner it built up in.  Making it update the x direction back and forth instead of in the same direction made it at least
distribute evenly along the x axis.  It turned out to be related to the fact that I was only allowing the propane to move diagonally,
which somehow affected it.  It could also have been related to the random function I was using. (if rand() < 0.5 { 1 } else { -1 }).

Changing the random function to allow for 1, 0, or -1 made it always go into the top left corner because it was slightly favoring
a modifier of -1.  Revising the random func to give equal weight to 1 and -1 with a minor bias towards 0 fixed the problem entirely,
without needing to sweep back and forth
